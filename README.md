### Description

WE are in the period of the World Cup and it's the subject of our day.
So I think about creating a BINGO game that show all the years and the winners of this combitions from it's beginnig in 1930 until this version 2022 (22 times + 2 times cancelled). I chose React js as a technology for the developement.
I created a fake API for the years and the winners, to consult it you can visite the link [API World Cup](https://tahiriabdo131.github.io/fake-api-world-cup-winners/winners.json).


### Rules

- A player wins by completing a row, column, or diagonal.
- There's a free slot (always on) in the middle
- You can have multiple bingos

### More details

- The player can replay by clicking on the button replay.
- The player can see how many bingos he got
